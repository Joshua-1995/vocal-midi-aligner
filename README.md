# ðŸŽ¼ Vocal-MIDI Aligner
**vocal-midi-aligner** is a Python library for aligning sung vocal pitch contours (from `.wav` files) with symbolic note sequences (from `.mid` files).  
It improves upon traditional DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) by incorporating additional features like note duration, silence handling, and unvoiced penalties for more accurate alignment.

---

### âœ… Features

- **Silence-aware boundary matching**  
  Detects leading and trailing silence in vocals and aligns accordingly.
  
- **Multi-factor alignment cost**  
  - `lambda_pitch`: Pitch mismatch weight  
  - `lambda_duration`: Note duration mismatch weight  
  - `lambda_unvoiced`: Penalty for mismatched voiced/unvoiced frames

- **Duration-aware DTW**  
  Prevents extreme stretching/compression by incorporating note durations into the cost matrix.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HGU-DLLAB/vocal-midi-aligner.git
cd vocal-midi-aligner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸŽµ Basic Usage Example

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from aligner.vocal_note_align import VocalNoteAlign

wav_path = "YOUR_WAV_FILE_PATH"
midi_path = "YOUR_MIDI_FILE_PATH"

# Create the aligner object
aligner = VocalNoteAlign(
    lambda_pitch=3,       # Weight for pitch difference
    lambda_duration=0.1,  # Weight for duration mismatch
    lambda_unvoiced=20,   # Penalty for unvoiced/silence mismatch
    sampling_rate=22050,
    hop_length=256
)

# Perform alignment
vocal_pitch, aligned_note_pitch = aligner.multi_process_run(wav_path, midi_path)

plt.title("Vocal Pitch and Aligned Note Pitch")
plt.plot(vocal_pitch, label="Vocal Pitch")
plt.plot(aligned_note_pitch, label="Aligned Note Pitch")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
